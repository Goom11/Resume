Work Experience
---------------

**Facebook** Software Engineer, July 2017 - Current, Intern, July 2015 - September 2015 & July 2016 - September 2016

Worked on the [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) team, Facebook's custom IDE written primarily in Javascript and Flow using ReactJS and Observables (RxJS). Collaborated with partner and cross-functional teams, developed project plans, and communicated timelines and progress regularly.

**Java Debugger**

* **DAP Migration**: Rewrote Nuclide's in-house Java debugger to speak [Microsoft's Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/)
    * Wrote multithreaded Java, debugged race conditions, added end-to-end tests, and properly used locks
* **Driving Adoption**: Single-handedly conducted user research with developers to prioritize tasks. Drove adoption through better console expression evaluation, evaluate-on-hover support for variables in code, and support for custom source paths allowing developers to debug library and non-standard code.
    * Used analytics infrastructure to measure changes in daily, weekly, and monthly usage

**Python Support**

* **Python Debugger**: Synced over two years of open source commits for the Python debugger resulting in faster performance and bug fixes
    * Added custom support for Django developer containers providing port forwarding, path mapping, and a Chef deployment of Nuclide
* **Format on Save**: Developed feature in Nuclide that formats file on save, pairing the appropriate formatter with the formatter configuration specific to a file's repository


**Daiquery**

* **Uhaul Integration**: Improving Data Scientists' UX by integrating two separate, but commonly used tools
    * Reduced cognitive overhead by remembering dependencies between queries and data transfers
    * Helped users compile queries more easily by pulling in metadata of datasets
