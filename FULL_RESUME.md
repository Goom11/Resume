Work Experience
---------------

**Facebook** Software Engineer, July 2017 - Current

[Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) is a custom IDE for Facebook developers written primarily in Javascript and Flow using ReactJS and Observables (RxJS).

**Java Debugger**

* **DAP Migration**: Rewrote Nuclide's in house Java debugger to speak [Microsoft's Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/)  as part of a project to migrate all Nuclide debuggers to speak the same protocol
    * Wrote multithreaded Java and learned to debug race conditions and properly use locks
    * Wrote end-to-end tests
* **Driving Adoption**: Conducted user research on FB Android developers and drove adoption by developing features including better console expression evaluation, evaluate on hover support for variables in code, support for custom source paths allowing developers to debug library and other non standard code, and more
    * Used analytics infrastructure to measure changes in daily, weekly, and monthly usage

**Python Support**

* **User Research**: Conducted user interviews and user surverys to find users' biggest pain points
* **Python Debugger**: Sync And FB Specific Integrations
    * Pulled in upstream changes for the Python debugger, pulling in over two years worth of open source commits resulting in greater performance, bug fixes and additional features
    * Added custom support for Instagram Django Python developers who work inside of a tupperware container and need custom port forwarding and path mapping as well as a custom Chef deployment of Nuclide
* **Format On Save**: Feature in Nuclide that would format your file on save, using the appropriate formatter and formatter configuration according to your file's repository
    * Worked with FB Lint teams
    * Like all other projects, I communicated my progress by sharing a live document consisting of a breakdown of the tasks, a timeline, and any notes on what was currently blocking my progress

**Facebook** Software Engineering Intern, July 2016 - September 2016

* Uhaul-Daiquery Integration: Improving Data Scientist's UX by integrating two separate but commonly used together tools
    * Reduced cognitive overhead by remembering dependencies between queries and data transfers
    * Reduced cognitive overhead by pulling in metadata of datasets to help users compile queries more easily

**Facebook** Software Engineering Intern, July 2015 - September 2015

* [pcomponents](http://componentkit.org/docs/debugging.html#pcomponents): debugging tool for [ComponentKit](http://componentkit.org/), a React-inspired view framework for iOS
    * Used by Facebook's iOS developers
    * automatically generates debugging information for the app's bug reports
    * Open sourced, I have met developers outside of Facebook who use it
* Performance Components: tool for measuring Component creation and layout computation times
    * Generated data to determine which components used the most time
* Shimmering Stories: changed the way new Facebook posts load
    * Changes increased user interaction during the period in which new posts were being loaded from the server

**Coupa Software** Software Engineering Intern, July 2013 - September 2013

* Created and setup a developer VM
    * Decreased ramp up time for new developers
* Added the Visa Commercial Format and Orbitz Travel documents to the system
    * Allowed for Visa corporate card expenses and Orbitz travel expenses to be used by the expense management system

**The Coding School** Instructor, 2014 - 2017

* Taught HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Unity to Middle School Students
* Learned what makes programming difficult to learn and how tools can make this easier
* Helped design and provide feedback on course curriculums
