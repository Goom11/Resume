Work Experience
---------------

**Facebook** Software Engineer, July 2017 - Current, Intern, July 2015 - September 2015 & July 2016 - September 2016

Worked on the [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) team, Facebook's custom IDE written primarily in Javascript and Flow using ReactJS and Observables (RxJS). Collaborated with partner and cross-functional teams, developed project plans, and communicated timelines and progress regularly.

**Java Debugger**

* **DAP Migration**: Rewrote Nuclide's in-house Java debugger to speak [Microsoft's Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/)
    * Wrote multithreaded Java, debugged race conditions, added end-to-end tests, and properly used locks
* **Driving Adoption**: Single-handedly conducted user research with developers to prioritize tasks. Drove adoption through better console expression evaluation, evaluate-on-hover support for variables in code, and support for custom source paths allowing developers to debug library and non-standard code.
    * Used analytics infrastructure to measure changes in daily, weekly, and monthly usage

**Python Support**

* **Python Debugger**: Synced over two years of open source commits for the Python debugger resulting in faster performance and bug fixes
    * Added custom support for Django developer containers providing port forwarding, path mapping, and a Chef deployment of Nuclide
* **Format on Save**: Developed feature in Nuclide that formats file on save, pairing the appropriate formatter with the formatter configuration specific to a file's repository


**Daiquery**

* **Uhaul Integration**: Improving Data Scientists' UX by integrating two separate, but commonly used tools
    * Reduced cognitive overhead by remembering dependencies between queries and data transfers
    * Helped users compile queries more easily by pulling in metadata of datasets

**ComponentKit**

* **[pcomponents](http://componentkit.org/docs/debugging.html#pcomponents)**: debugging tool for [ComponentKit](http://componentkit.org/), a React-inspired view framework for iOS
    * Used by Facebook's iOS developers
    * automatically generates debugging information for the app's bug reports
    * Open sourced, I have met developers outside of Facebook who use it
* **Performance Components**: tool for measuring Component creation and layout computation times
    * Generated data to determine which components used the most time
* **Shimmering Stories**: changed the way new Facebook posts load
    * Changes increased user interaction during the period in which new posts were being loaded from the server

**Coupa Software** Software Engineering Intern, June 2013 - September 2013

* Created and setup a developer VM
    * Decreased ramp up time for new developers
* Added the Visa Commercial Format and Orbitz Travel documents to the system
    * Allowed for Visa corporate card expenses and Orbitz travel expenses to be used by the expense management system

**The Coding School** Instructor, 2014 - 2017

* Taught HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Unity to Middle School Students
* Learned what makes programming difficult to learn and how tools can make this easier
* Helped design and provide feedback on course curriculums

Projects
--------

**[Amanphic](http://goom11.github.io/VisualSimulations/)**: April 2016

* An exploration into making abstractions easier to understand and create
* Uses a "Prototype tree" which combines advantages of both classical and prototypical inheritance
* Displays many instances of a class to help users better understand the abstraction that the class provides

**FBCLI**: April 2013

* Web-based command line interface for Facebook
* Wrote the input parser and passed parsed tokens to their respective functions
* 2013 Facebook SoCal Hackathon Winner
