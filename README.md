Experience
----------

**Facebook**

* [pcomponents](http://componentkit.org/docs/debugging.html#pcomponents): debugging tool for [ComponentKit](http://componentkit.org/), a React-inspired view framework for iOS
    * Used by Facebook's iOS developers
    * Its output automatically gets added in the main Facebook iOS app's bug reports
    * Open sourced, I have met developers outside of Facebook who use it
* Performance Components: tool for measuring Component creation and layout computation times
    * This data was then later used to improve the performance of the Facebook iOS app by identifying how much time each component took, both the time for an individual component and the sum total time for all of a specific kind of component
* Shimmering Stories: project that changed the way new Facebook stories load by replacing a toggled view with a component that imitates regular stories
    * Changes allowed for these "Shimmering Stories" to be inserted and used in more than just the News Feed, like in Groups and Pages and all other kinds of "feeds"
    * Also allowed for these "Shimmering Stories" to be inserted at the tail end of pages as more stories were loading from the bottom

**Coupa Software**

* Created and setup a developer VM
    * New developers could now use this VM instead of going through a long and complicated installation process
* Added the Visa Commercial Format to the system by writing Rails code that parsed the format into the system's internal format
    * Allowed for Visa expenses to be used by the expense management system
* Shipped similar functionality for Orbitz Travel documents
    * Allowed for Orbitz travel expenses to be input into the system
